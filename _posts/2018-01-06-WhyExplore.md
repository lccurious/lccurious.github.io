# On the Impact of a 0.12 kg Apple with the Head

## Abstract

We have carried out an experimental study to determine quantitatively the risks faced by people standing under an apple tree. The Collision Induced Pain (CIP) produced by a 0.12 kg apple on the head was measured.

## Introduction

Since the early days of Creation, Man has been interested in apples [1]. Its nutritive properties [2] as well as its potential toxicity have been thoroughly discussed [3]. More recently, apples have found important technological applications [4]. However, little attention has been given to the critical issue of the risks faced by the eventual fruit picker who approaches the branches of an apple tree.

## Experimental procedure and results

An experiment was carried out to determine the effect of an apple falling on the head. The experimental setup is sketched in Fig. 1. The experimenter sat under an apple tree for five consecutive days and different intervals of time ∆t (Table 1). On the fifth day an apple fell on the experimenter’s head from a distance d=1.8±0.1 metres. The mass of the apple was found to be M=0.12±0.01 kg. Immediately after the collision the experimenter reported a mild discomfort that decreased exponentially with time as he rubbed his hand against the Apple Impact Area (AIA).

| Day | $$\Delta t$$(hours) | Apples fallen |
| :-: | :-----------------: | :-----------: |
|  1  |         1.3         |       0       |
|  2  |         0.6         |       0       |
|  3  |         2.1         |     1(\*)     |
|  4  |         1.4         |       0       |
|  5  |         1.8         |       1       |

On a scale of 0 to 10, the Collision Induced Pain (CIP) was rated as 2.3±0.1 (Fig. 2) and it decreased down to negligible values after a time τ=14.6±0.5 seconds. Some authors suggest that a more vigorous rubbing on the AIA would reduce substantially the Pain Relaxation Time (PRT) [5], although this theory has been highly disputed. No structural damage was observed in the experimenter’s skull.

## Conclusion

A quantitative determination of the effect of an apple falling on the head was carried out for the first time. A 0.12 kg apple falling on the experimenter’s head from a distance of 1.8 metres was found to produce a CIP of 2.3±0.1 arbitrary units. A future development of this work includes the measurement of the CIP induced by apples of different mass and investigating the collision with pears. These studies will be carried out as soon as the author finds a PhD student as he is not very keen on repeating the experience himself.

刚接到这个问题的时候，刚好是梁漱溟先生辞世30周年那天，一整天的脑子里都是《中国文化要义》封面上的一行话在环绕不断

> 独立思考，表里如一

想起来感触最深的就是他曾回忆起他的父亲在他年轻时问他的一个问题：

> 这个世界会好吗？

我以为这是培养一种发现问题，提出问题，解决问题的能力。
早上起来我姑娘突然问了我一个好像很严肃的话题：

> 好像大家都要去做科研了，然而我对于这种热情抱有怀疑。

我只想到，我的精神家园，从王小波那里听来的词汇，我借过来用。我的精神家园，应该有很多内容，虽然现在它还很贫瘠，我有很多书要读，我想要更具幽默感和智慧，我想做事情能够周密有条理，我想变的温柔而强大，我想能用心感受到爱，我想在我什么都不想做的时候也不会觉得人生太过虚无，我想寻常的日子里能比较繁忙好让我享受到忙里偷闲的那一点乐趣，就像是蛋糕上最开始的那一口，我想能够建立起属于自己的精神家园。可是，它不是凭空想想就能得来的。我以前常常陷入虚无，聚会结束以后，和家人分开以后，放了假以后，剧荒了以后。但是我想能够锻炼出自己的那一份能力。于最无聊没有意义的人生中，找到自己的节奏。
