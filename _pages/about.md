Mainly focused on causal discovery and inference methods for open‑world observational data, including **causal discovery algorithms**, **transfer learning algorithms**, interpretability of machine learning, learning strategies in loops, machine learning theory, etc. Also dedicated to applying causal discovery and inference algorithms to the interpretation of “neuro‑behavioral” data and causal effect inference in medical data. For example, discovering the characteristics of the circuit between premotor movement signals and central pattern generators of Drosophila larvae, digital twin networks in mouse V1 visual cortex, drug molecule discovery, and effect inference.
