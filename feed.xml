However, enhancing these models’ abilities during pretraining period requires costly data collection and significant memory resources, which grow quadratically. Consequently, in the past year, large context window technology has become a highly contested field, drawing significant attention and debate. There are two desired properties: the input context length and the model output length. Generally, more focus is placed on the input context length, as few individuals, apart from those wishing LLMs to compose lengthy narratives, are interested in reading extensive output contexts.</p> <p>Large context conditions are extremely important during the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) process because we aim for LLMs to read comprehensive materials and either output a perfect summary or utilize the key ideas from retrieved references. Indeed, while some models claim to read entire books, ongoing development has led to the expectation that, on the other hand, models be able to process a list of books, extensive tables, and more. Therefore, LLMs are on track to become an indispensable part of the workflow.</p> <p>However, with limited resources at hand, most users are unable to retrain or fine-tune the models. Therefore, there is an urgent demand for creating resource-efficient adaptation and inference methods. These methods should ideally eliminate the need for retraining or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).</p> <p>There are three sounds similar lines:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Length Extrapolation</p> </li> <li> <p>Context Window Extension</p> </li> <li> <p>Improving LLMs’ Utilization of Long Text</p> </li> </ol> <h2 id="previous-limitation">Previous Limitation</h2> <p>As demonstrated in the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15595">📑Chen et al., 2023</a>, they use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">coeffs</code> linear fitting task show the abnormal attention amplitude appeared in the position exceed the pre-training context window size.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2024-02-25-Extend-LLMs-Context-Window/c5930799_Untitled-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2024-02-25-Extend-LLMs-Context-Window/c5930799_Untitled-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2024-02-25-Extend-LLMs-Context-Window/c5930799_Untitled-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024-02-25-Extend-LLMs-Context-Window/c5930799_Untitled.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Untitled" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2024-02-25-Extend-LLMs-Context-Window/c24e744a_Untitled-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2024-02-25-Extend-LLMs-Context-Window/c24e744a_Untitled-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2024-02-25-Extend-LLMs-Context-Window/c24e744a_Untitled-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2024-02-25-Extend-LLMs-Context-Window/c24e744a_Untitled.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Untitled" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>As what discussed in the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15595">📑Chen et al., 2023</a>, models often experience a catastrophic drop in performance when the input context window is directly extended. The root cause of this issue lies in the behavior of attention scores, which can become erratic due to encountering unexpected values—typically those exceeding the maximum context length used during the pretraining phase. This erratic behavior can lead to the generation of disproportionately large attention coefficients, thereby degrading the model’s representation capabilities. To mitigate this issue, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15595">📑Chen et al., 2023</a> proposed an on-the-fly context re-distribution interpolation method that effectively prevents these abnormal jumps in attention scores:</p> \[\begin{equation} \mathbf{f}'(\boldsymbol{x},m)=\mathbf{f}\left( \boldsymbol{x},\frac{mL}{L'} \right), \end{equation}\] <p>Where \(L’\) represents the new maximum context window length. Using this scaling method, the position of each new input token can be accurately mapped into the original feasible numerical region, ensuring compatibility with the model’s pretrained structure.</p> <p>Currently, no fine-tuning-free methods are available for this adjustment. However, LongRoPE <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13753">📑Ding et al., 2024</a> extends the context length by rescaling the RoPE positional encoding <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864">📑Su et al., 2023</a> frequencies, allowing for a gradual extension of the context window.

Dufour）于1872年在气体中发现的。杜伏效应是索瑞效应的逆效应。</li> <li><strong>受体（Receptor）：</strong>指一类能传导细胞外信号，并在细胞内产生特定效应的分子。包括膜受体和胞内受体。</li> <li><strong>配体（Ligand）：</strong>指一种能与受体结合以产生某种生理效果的物质。细胞外能与受体结合的分子一般称之为配体，包括激素生长因子，细胞因子，神经递质，还有其他各种各样的小分子化合物</li> </ul> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2023-02-24-MST-Analysis/receptor1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2023-02-24-MST-Analysis/receptor1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2023-02-24-MST-Analysis/receptor1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023-02-24-MST-Analysis/receptor1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-0" width="100%" height="auto" title="rl-1" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">rl-1</figcaption> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2023-02-24-MST-Analysis/receptor2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2023-02-24-MST-Analysis/receptor2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2023-02-24-MST-Analysis/receptor2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023-02-24-MST-Analysis/receptor2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-0" width="100%" height="auto" title="rl-2" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">rl-2</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2023-02-24-MST-Analysis/response-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2023-02-24-MST-Analysis/response-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2023-02-24-MST-Analysis/response-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2023-02-24-MST-Analysis/response.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-0" width="100%" height="auto" title="response" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">response</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <hr/> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>Wienken, C., Baaske, P., Rothbauer, U. et al.

rel="footnote">1</a></sup></h2> <ol> <li>通过双引号要求搜索结果必须包含双引号中的内容，例如：<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">optimal transport lccurious</code>，要求搜索引擎必须按照双引号中的短语顺序检索结果；</li> <li>使用减号排除包含减号后的搜索结果，例如：<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transformer -csdn</code>，就可以排除掉搜索结果中所有与csdn相关的条目了；</li> <li>使用<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site</code>关键词让返回的条目只包括在某个指定站点的内容，例如：<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">latex site:github.io</code>，让返回条目中只包含在“github.io”站点下的内容；</li> <li>使用<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">link</code>关键词让返回的条目内容中都包含链接了指定的网站，例如：<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">link:github.com</code>，过滤掉那些不包含“github.com”这个链接的条目，需要注意的是只要网页源代码里有指向该链接的条目都会被视为符合规则（即使页面上肉眼不可见）；</li> <li>通配符检索用<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code>充当一个占位符，过滤出仅<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code>位置位置不同的组合内容搜索结果，例如<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"The most genius * in the world”</code>，就可以过滤出所有世界上最天才的xxx的搜索结果；</li> <li>近似含义说明符号<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> ，例如：<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">happy ~dog</code>；</li> <li>使用<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">related</code>关键词搜索所有内容相关或者类似的网站，例如：<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">related:dribbble.com</code>就可以直接搜索到与这个素材网站相似的其他网站；</li> <li>计算一些简单的数学内容，例如：<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exp(10)+sin(10)</code>；</li> <li>快速换算单位，例如：<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">100日元=?人民币</code>；</li> <li>使用<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">define</code>关键词搜索定义，例如：<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">define:normal</code> 、<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">define:沁园春</code>；</li> <li>使用<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AND</code>、<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OR</code>等进行组合搜索，Google搜索默认情况下都是使用AND逻辑，即所有关键词都命中的结果才会被返回，但是也可以手动改用OR的逻辑，例如：<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transfer learning OR domain adaptation</code>；</li> <li>搜索包括指定数字范围内的内容，例如：<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">causal discovery 2020..2022</code>就会大概返回2020年到2022年之间的文章；</li> <li>使用<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filetype</code>关键词，例如：<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cpi ppi 差 filetype:pdf</code>基本上返回的都是与CPI、PPI指数相关的研报PDF文件等；</li> <li>使用<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inurl</code>关键字，例如：<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inurl:mp4 “瑞克和莫蒂”</code>，在所有返回结果中，网页链接中包含第一个关键字<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mp3</code>，第二个关键字<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">瑞克和莫蒂</code>出现在链接中或网页文档中；</li> <li>使用<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">allinurl</code>关键字，例如：<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">allinurl:”cgi-bin” phf +com</code>，让返回的网页链接中包含所有关键字；</li> <li>使用<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">intitle</code>、<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">allintitle</code> 关键字对标题栏（即网页标签页名字）进行搜索，例如：<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">intitle:😧</code> 就可以搜索所有标签页带这个表情的页面了；</li> <li>同理还存在<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inanchor</code>、<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">allinanchor</code> 这类关键字；</li> <li>使用<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cache</code> 关键词可以在Google的缓存页面上进行查询；</li> </ol> <h2 id="google学术搜索">Google学术搜索</h2> <ol> <li>使用 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">author</code> 关键词限定作者如<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">author:"Kun Zhang" AND intitle:"Causal"</code> ；</li> <li>使用 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source</code>关键词指定来源，与<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site</code>类似，有时<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site</code>范围太广，使用<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source</code>更精确。 如<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"kernel method" source:"Advances in Neural Information Processing"</code>，搜索<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nips</code>包含<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kernel method</code>全部论文；</li> <li>使用 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">intext</code>关键词，例如：<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">intext:("kernel method" -"semi-supervised learning")</code>，搜索内容中包含<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kernel mehtod</code>且不包含<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">semi-supervised learning</code>的论文；</li> <li>对于某网址对应多个期刊的情况，使用<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source</code>而不是<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site</code>进行界定。如TPAMI对应网址<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ieee.org</code>有很多期刊，而其对应来源为<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</code>；</li> </ol>

You just need to surround your math expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code>, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$ E = mc^2 $$</code>. If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like \(E = mc^2\).</p> <p>To use display mode, again surround your expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code> and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:</p> \[\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)\] <p>Note that MathJax 3 is <a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html">a major re-write of MathJax</a> that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now <a href="http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php">on par with KaTeX</a>.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="citations">Citations</h2> <p>Citations are then used in the article body with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-cite&gt;</code> tag. The key attribute is a reference to the id provided in the bibliography. The key attribute can take multiple ids, separated by commas.</p> <p>The citation is presented inline like this: <d-cite key="gregor2015draw"></d-cite> (a number that displays more information on hover). If you have an appendix, a bibliography is automatically created and populated in it.</p> <p>Distill chose a numerical inline citation style to improve readability of citation dense articles and because many of the benefits of longer citations are obviated by displaying more information on hover. However, we consider it good style to mention author last names if you discuss something at length and it fits into the flow well — the authors are human and it’s nice for them to have the community associate them with their work.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2> <p>Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-footnote&gt;</code> tag. The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote></p> <hr/> <h2 id="code-blocks">Code Blocks</h2> <p>Syntax highlighting is provided within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-code&gt;</code> tags. An example of inline code snippets: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-code language="html"&gt;let x = 10;&lt;/d-code&gt;</code>. For larger blocks of code, add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">block</code> attribute:</p> <d-code block="" language="javascript"> var x = 25; function(x) { return x * x; } </d-code> <p><strong>Note:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;d-code&gt;</code> blocks do not look good in the dark mode. You can always use the default code-highlight using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">highlight</code> liquid tag:</p> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">25</span><span class="p">;</span>
